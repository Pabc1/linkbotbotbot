# linkbotbotbot
##### The totally not useless link saving bot
---

This bot's whole purpose is to store the links being shared in the channel he's invited to (or links shared to him directly) in order to be able to retrieve them later. How is this useful? I don't know. Maybe you could use it as a sort of bookmark.

### What can he do?

* Store links.
* Show links shared in a the channel.
* Query links by user who shared them, channel it was shared in, tags, etc.
* Deletes links stored by user.

### How to use it?

linkbotbotbot hears and stores by default all the links in the channel he's invited to without needing to use any command. He does this silently as not to clutter the channel with unnecessary messages.

#### Tags

You can add tags after a link in order to be able to search for links with them.
To add tags you can use the following syntax:

> [www.reallycoolpage.com](https://xkcd.com/) [tag1] [tag2] [tag3]

Spaces between tags are optional.

#### Query by user

You can search links shared by a specific user using the following syntax:

> links shared by [@reallycooluser](https://xkcd.com/327/)

#### Query by channel

You can search links shared in a specific channel usint the following syntax:

> links shared
